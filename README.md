BeesWax is a community uploaded opensource coupon finder , created to serve as an alternative to profit-motivated coupon services due to various issues they pose.

These issues had initially come to my attention from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4yL3YTwWk , full credit for the creator for uncovering these issues

TLDW: 
Affiliate cookies, which are used to reward various services for advertising sales on eCommerce sites, work on a last-click basis; the last service that claims the cookie will be rewarded
Honey, as well as some other coupon finder extentionsm, injects your purchase with their own affiliate cookie from their popups when you check out, therby giving them the entire reward for capturing your sale
This is problematic because:
1) it takes away credit from real services that should be rewarded for your purchase eg influencers 
2) it takes credit for your sale even if no coupons are found
3) honey also can hide better deals from you in order to entice eCommerce sites to work with them
